# My Portfolio

This is a portfolio project built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Workbox. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience in web development.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is built with a responsive design, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Modern UI with Tailwind CSS**: The project utilizes the Tailwind CSS framework to create a clean and visually appealing user interface. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid styling and customization, resulting in a modern and professional design.

- **React Components**: The portfolio is developed using React, taking advantage of reusable and modular components. This approach enhances maintainability and scalability of the codebase.

This enables the portfolio to function offline by caching important assets and providing a seamless user experience even in low or no network connectivity situations.
